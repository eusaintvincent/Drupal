# Getting started

## Description

This module improves the administration of blocks.

For a full description visit the [project page].

The edit_ui module does nothing if enabled alone.

You will need to activate one or more of its sub-modules to get some benefits :
* edit_ui_block : Allows the block layout to be managed directly in the frontend with drag and drop.
* edit_ui_contextual : Improves contextual action for blocks.  

## Requirements

None.

## installation

Install as usual, see [here][module install] for further information.
